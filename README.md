# Corporate Decarbonization Research
Dara O'Rourke and Zcjanin Ollesca


## Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple database containing comparable corporate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and net-zero progress from high carbon-emitting firms. From this database, we analyzed GHG emissions and internal decarbonization strategies through observing trends in factors such as absolute emissions, total revenue, and carbon intensity encompassing the years 2017 through 2023 in order to understand the overall progress of prominent firms in reaching a net-zero future. The data contained in this preliminary analysis covers around 90 companies from four high-emitting sectors (energy, automobiles, food & agriculture, and technology) taken from a combination of sources, including the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), company sustainability reports, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI).
