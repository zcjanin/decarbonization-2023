# Corporate Decarbonization Research

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple database containing comparable corporate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and net-zero progress from high carbon-emitting firms. From this database, we analyzed GHG emissions and internal decarbonization strategies through observing trends in factors such as absolute emissions, total revenue, and carbon intensity encompassing the years 2017 through 2023 in order to understand the overall progress of prominent firms in reaching a net-zero future. The data contained in this preliminary analysis covers around 90 companies from four high-emitting sectors (energy, automobiles, food & agriculture, and technology) taken from a combination of sources, including the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), company sustainability reports, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
